# X-Ray-experiment

When electrons change energy levels, a photon must be emitted or absorbed. For Molybdenum in the L shell, the values of the wavelengths are λ_K_α_1 = 0.632 A ̊ and λ_K_α_2 = 0.709 A ̊ . These values are within the uncertainty of the results found in this experiment. This experiment also finds Planck’s constant to be within 4 % of the value established in the literature.
